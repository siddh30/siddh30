 ###### *(Switch to light mode for a better UI experience)* 

As a data enthusiast, I have an undying love for the applications of Machine Learning and Analytics. I have a passion for crunching insights from data to help organizations make key profitable business decisions. Being dedicated to functionality and curious about what's ahead of the curve, I keep my work practical, relevant, and creative.

I love working on projects involving Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Recommender Systems, and Python is my go-to language for programming.
I am a novice blogger beginning my journey on Medium with a mission to provide a structural understanding of Data Science - https://medium.com/@siddh30.
