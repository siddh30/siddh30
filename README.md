### Welcome to my github page
As a data enthusiast, I have an undying love for the applications of Machine Learning and Analytics. I have a passion for crunching insights from data to help organizations make key profitable business decisions. Being dedicated to functionality and curious about what's ahead of the curve, I keep my work practical, relevant, and creative.

I love working on projects involving Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Recommender Systems, and Python is my go-to language for programming. I am also a novice blogger beginning my journey on Medium with a mission to provide a structural understanding of Data Science and the ML pipeline.

Some projects that I am really proud of...

- Amazon Sentiment Analysis

https://github.com/siddh30/Amazon-Sentiment-Analysis

This project is about measuring the Custormer Sentiment on online books available at Amazon, based on ratings and reviews. These sentiments are classified as either 'Positive', 'Neutral' or 'Negative' and the best selected model has achived an accuracy of 89%.


- FastFoodieâ€Š- Restaurant Recommendation

https://share.streamlit.io/siddh30/fastfoodie-a-restaurant-recommendation-app/Main_App.py

FastFoodie is a Restaurant Recommendation Web Application that aims at recommending the closest and the highest rated restaurants in 20 cities across New York, New Jersey, California, Texas, and Washington. The data for this app was obtained by web scraping the TripAdvisor Website using BeautifulSoup and the app can be used by anyone without having prior knowledge of Machine Learning.



- Facial Keypoints Detection

https://github.com/siddh30/Facial-Keypoints-Detection

This is a Deep Learning project for the detection and prediction of facial key points and coordinates of facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth using CNN and LeNet. This project was made as an attempt to fight Deep-fakes.
